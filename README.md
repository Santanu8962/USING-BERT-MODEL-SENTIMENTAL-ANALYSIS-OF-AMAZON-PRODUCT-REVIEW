# Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews Using BERT

## Abstract
This repository contains code and documentation for performing sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. The study shows that BERT achieves an accuracy of 91.2% in classifying sentiments in product reviews, outperforming traditional machine learning methods.

## Introduction
Sentiment analysis extracts and interprets subjective information from textual data. This project focuses on analyzing Amazon product reviews to determine whether sentiments are positive, negative, or neutral. Using BERT, a pre-trained deep learning model, we aim to improve sentiment classification accuracy.

## Problem Statement
Traditional sentiment analysis methods often struggle with the nuanced and context-dependent nature of consumer opinions in Amazon product reviews. BERT’s bidirectional processing and deep contextual understanding provide a promising solution to this challenge.

## Aims
- Evaluate BERT’s effectiveness in classifying sentiment in Amazon product reviews.
- Compare BERT’s performance with other machine learning and deep learning methods.
- Investigate BERT’s impact on sentiment classification in a large-scale dataset.

## Related Work
- **BERT and Fine-Tuning:** Devlin et al. (2018) demonstrated BERT’s state-of-the-art performance in sentiment analysis.
- **Multi-Class Sentiment Classification:** Sun et al. (2019) explored multi-class sentiment analysis with BERT.
- **Domain-Specific Analysis:** Hsu et al. (2020) showed the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
We used a dataset of Amazon product reviews obtained from Kaggle. The dataset includes approximately 568,000 training reviews and 56,000 testing reviews.

### Data Preprocessing
- **Text Cleaning:** Remove special characters and HTML tags.
- **Tokenization:** Convert text into tokens using BERT’s tokenizer.
- **Formatting:** Add [CLS] and [SEP] tokens and generate input IDs, attention masks, and token type IDs.

### Feature Extraction
- **Embeddings:** Generate contextual embeddings for each token using BERT.

### Model Training
- **Pre-trained Model:** Load BERT (e.g., `bert-base-uncased`).
- **Fine-Tuning:** Train the model on sentiment-labeled Amazon reviews with a classification layer.

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy:** Measure the overall accuracy of sentiment classification.
- **Precision, Recall, F1 Score:** Evaluate performance across different sentiment classes.

## Libraries and Tools
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** `pip install transformers`
- **TensorFlow or PyTorch:** For model implementation.
- **Scikit-Learn:** For additional evaluation metrics.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation.
